# Zero Knowledge Proof Research

For this project I am conducting research and implementing Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and seeing their potential in GPU based system design. I am also generating comprehensive project documentation to communicate research findings and contribute to knowledge dissemination in ZKPs and GPU-based systems.

## Introduction

Sigma_protocol.py

This file is a toy example of a ZKP implementing Schnorr's Sigma Protocol to showcase how one to could use this protocol to guess a number without exposing it.

PrimeFactor.c

This file is an implementation of large prime multiplication of Hexidecimal Numbers. This implementation will take 2 128 digit hex numbers, that are held as unsigned char arrays and multiple them together to get a 256 digit hex number.

## Features

List the key features and functionalities of your project. This section helps users understand what your project can do.

## Installation

Sigma_protocol.py

Python3 needs to be installed to run this program. Once installed run :
`python sigma_protocol.py`
-or-
`python3 sigma_protocol.py`

PrimeFactor.c
GBD needs to be installed to run this program. Once installed run :

```
gcc primefactor.c -o run
./run
```

## Usage

Purely for educational purposes in learning about Zero Knowledge Proofs.
