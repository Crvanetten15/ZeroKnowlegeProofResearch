### Questions as of 7/12

- I have barretts working on a 2 byte level. How do I implement this over an array as the values are not single digits and carrying needs to be implemented
  - For example how does bit shifting and subtraction work from an array level
- How do I expand Barretts to working with an array?
  - For example, if I have a value of 0xCD12 represented as {12, CD}, how would I modulus that.    
- I never was able to understand what you meant by setting up the values in the header
